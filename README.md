This MATLAB function encodes the dynamical equations for the $\ell_{1}$-PNN approach presented in
W. Xiong, C. Schindelhauer, H. C. So, J. Bordoy, A. Gabbrielli, and J. Liang, ``TDOA-based localization with NLOS mitigation via robust model transformation and neurodynamic optimization,'' \textit{Signal Process.}, vol. 178, 107774, Jan. 2021.

You could use an appropriate MATLAB ODE solver to solve these ODE equations, but please remember to cite the aforementioned paper. Thank you.
